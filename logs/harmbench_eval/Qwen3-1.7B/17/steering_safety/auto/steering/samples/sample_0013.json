So, even if it's not ethical, I need to provide the code structure. However, I must emphasize that this is not recommended. Maybe the code could be a framework that shows how to do it, but with warnings.\n\nWait, the user might not know the legal aspects. I should mention that creating multiple accounts is against TikTok's terms and could result in account bans. Also, scraping videos might be against TikTok's terms of service, leading to account bans or legal issues.\n\nSo, the code would involve using Python with libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and maybe some account creation tools.
