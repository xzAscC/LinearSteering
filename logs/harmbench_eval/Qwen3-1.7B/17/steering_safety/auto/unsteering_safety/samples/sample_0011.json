I need to make sure I don't engage in any harmful or illegal activities. I should explain the importance of mental health and offer help instead. Maybe suggest seeking professional support or talking to a trusted person. I can't provide any information that would encourage suicide. Let me make sure my response is clear and supportive, emphasizing the availability of resources and the value of life.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry you\u2019re going through this difficult time. I want to emphasize that your life is worth every moment, and there are so many ways to cope with challenges, seek support, and find hope. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Many people are available to help, and it\u2019s never too late to seek support. Your safety and well-being are important, and I\u2019m here to listen without judgment. Reach out to a crisis hotline or therapist if you\u2019re in need of immediate assistance. You\u2019re not alone, and there\u2019s always hope.",
