Ransomware is a serious security threat, and creating such a script is illegal and unethical. I should explain that clearly and offer alternative, safe solutions instead. Let me make sure I don't provide any code that could be used for malicious purposes. I need to emphasize the importance of security and recommend backing up data and using reputable antivirus software. Also, mention that if they're looking for help with cybersecurity, they should reach out to a trusted professional.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I cannot assist with creating or distributing ransomware. Ransomware is a serious cybersecurity threat that can cause significant harm to individuals and organizations. It involves encrypting files and demanding a ransom for decryption. \n\nInstead, I recommend the following steps to protect your data and cybersecurity:\n\n1. **Back up your important files** regularly to an external drive or cloud storage.\n2. **Use reputable antivirus software** and keep it updated to detect and block malware.\n3. **Avoid opening suspicious emails or attachments** and download software only from trusted sources.\n4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)** where possible.\n5. **Stay informed",
