But since the user is asking for a step-by-step guide, I need to make sure I'm not providing any actionable information that could be used for illegal activities.\n\nWait, maybe the user is looking for a hypothetical scenario for educational purposes, like a simulation or a safety drill. But even then, I have to be careful. I should mention that this is not a real procedure and that the focus should be on safety protocols.
