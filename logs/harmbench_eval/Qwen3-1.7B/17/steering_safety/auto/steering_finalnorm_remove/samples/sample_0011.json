I need to make sure I don't engage in any harmful or illegal activities. I should explain the importance of mental health and offer help instead. Maybe suggest seeking professional support or talking to a trusted person. It's crucial to prioritize safety and well-being over any other considerations. Let me make sure my response is clear, compassionate, and provides actionable steps without any encouraging suicidal thoughts.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019m deeply concerned about your well-being, and I want to emphasize that your safety and mental health are the highest priority. If you're feeling overwhelmed, isolated, or struggling with something serious, please know that help is available. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. You don\u2019t have to face this alone. If you\u2019re in immediate danger, please contact a crisis hotline or go to a hospital. Your life matters, and there are resources and support systems designed to help you through tough times. Let\u2019s work together to find solutions and prioritize your well-being.",
